Welcome to Makshouf – Your Car Maintenance Companion

Makshouf is a mobile application based in Saudi Arabia that connects car owners with certified car maintenance centers. Through the app, users (customers) can submit repair or maintenance requests and receive bids from nearby workshops. The customer can then select the most suitable service provider based on location, price, and ratings. This policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal data.

1. Information We Collect
Personal Information: Name, phone number, email address, car model, and location.

Payment Information: When payments are made through the app, we securely process billing details through a third-party payment processor.

Usage Data: Information about how the app is used, such as service requests, selected providers, and transaction history.

2. How We Use Your Information
To match customers with nearby service centers.

To facilitate communication between users and workshops.

To process and track payments.

With Legal Authorities: When required by law or legal process.

4. Earnings and Payments
Customers pay the full service amount either via cash or through the app.

Makshouf receives 5% commission on each completed transaction.

The service provider receives 95% of the transaction amount.

5. Refund & Cancellation Policy
If a request is submitted and paid for, but not accepted by any service center, the user may cancel the request at any time with a full refund and no fees.

If a service center accepts the request, and the customer then decides to cancel, 50% of the paid amount will be deducted, and 50% will be refunded.

No refunds will be issued after service work has begun or has been completed.

7. Common Terms of Use in Automotive Service Apps
Makshouf acts as a third-party platform facilitating service requests and payments but is not liable for the actual repair quality.

All service centers are independently operated and responsible for their work.

Disputes must be addressed directly between the customer and the service center, with Makshouf offering mediation support when needed.

User ratings and reviews help guide future customers but do not guarantee outcomes.

All parties agree to comply with Saudi consumer protection laws.
